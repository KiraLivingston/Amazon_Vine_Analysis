## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.

It's clear after this analysis that there's a significant up-tick in positive reviews when the review was paid for. If you wanted to be sure of the results, you could compare how many paid Vine reviews result in a star rating of less than 3, to determine how many reviewers are willing to honestly review a product notwithstanding the money they've received.
